# Introduction {#introduction}

Many academic responsibilities require some type of survey. A clear example is a simple demographic form. Our package allows you to easily create questionnaires using Shiny.[^1] We provide two functions to do this: `surveyOutput()` and `renderSurvey()`. Both of these functions take in a data frame containing question information that follows a specific format. To illustrate them in use, we will show you a questionnaire from McGowan et al (2021) that is built into the `shinysurveys` package:

[^1]: We assume that you are familiar with the basic layout of a Shiny application. If not, please check out RStudio's [great resources](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) before completing this vignette.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions
```

As seen, this is a tidy data frame, where each row is a unique observation and each column is a variable. While there are 54 rows, there are only 11 unique questions:

```{r display unique questions}
unique(shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions$question)
```

Each question has seven variables that dictate how it functions within the survey. They are described in the data set documentation, accessed by calling `?shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions` in your console, as follows:

-   *question*: The question to be asked.
-   *option*: A possible response to the question. In multiple choice questions, for example, this would be the possible answers. For questions without discrete answers, such as a numeric input, this would be the default option shown on the input.
-   *input\_type*: What type of response is expected? Currently supported types include `numeric`, `mc` for multiple choice, `text`, `select`,and `y/n` for yes/no questions.
-   *input\_id*: The input id for Shiny inputs.
-   *dependence*: Does this question (row) depend on another? That is, should it only appear if a different question has a specific value? This column contains the input\_id of whatever question this one depends upon.
-   *dependence\_value*: This column contains the specific value that the dependence question must take for this question (row) to be shown.
-   *required*: logical TRUE/FALSE signifying if a question is required.

# Examples

Below are examples of the currently supported question types. We provide a thorough explanation for the numeric input, but only point out notable differences for other inputs.

## Numeric Input

A good example of a numeric input is the first question: "What's your age?":

```{r what is your age preview, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(input_id == "age")
```
uset
As we noted in the [introduction](#Introduction), this row shows us that the question is "What's your age?". We know we are expecting a numeric input by looking at the `input_type` column, and the default value is equal to 25 according to the `option` column.

> It is important to note that the `option` column for numeric inputs provides the default value, but for other types -- as we will see -- provides the possible options for a question.

We can also tell that there are no dependency questions. This means that no matter what value you enter, no follow-up question will appear. Lastly, we know this is a required question.[^2]

[^2]: Required question functionality will be discussed in more detail in the section [Required Questions](#required_questions).

## Multiple Choice (mc) Input {#multiple_choice}

An example of this is the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender mc, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Unlike numeric inputs, the `option` column represents each of the possible responses for this question. You may notice that the fifth row of this question has *NA* in the `option` column and "text" in the `input_type` column. We will discuss this in more detail [below](#Question%20Dependencies), but for now note that this question has a dependent. That is, if a specific option is chosen for this question, a new one will appear below. In this case, a question that accepts text as its input.

![Multiple Choice Example](images/mc_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

## Text Input {#text_input}

Questions that need text-based input should specify "text" in the `input_type` column. As noted in the previous example, the following is a dependent of the question "Which best describes your gender?":

```{r what is your gender text, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

It's important to note that the `option` column for text-based inputs can be left blank (i.e. NA) or contain a character string. If they are left empty, the text field will display "Placeholder." Otherwise, the character string will be displayed:

![Text input placeholder](images/text_input_placeholder.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![Text input character string](images/text_input_character_string.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300" height="71"}

## Select Input

Select inputs are great when there are many potential, discretely defined, response choices.[^3] An example is the question "What was your first language?" contains `r teaching_r_questions %>% dplyr::filter(question == "What was your first language?") %>% dplyr::count()` rows because there are that many options to choose from:[^4]

[^3]: As of October 2020, these do not support multiple options selected at once, though we anticipate adding this functionality in the future.

[^4]: Note the presence of the NA in the output above. This deals with question dependencies, which is explained in detail in the section [Dependency Questions](#Question%20Dependencies).

```{r show first language options, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(question == "What was your first language?") %>%
  dplyr::pull(option)
```

![Select input example](images/select_input_example.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

## Yes or No (y/n) Input

Yes or no questions are self-explanatory. An example is the question "Have you ever learned to program in R?":

```{r learned to program in R, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(input_id == "learned_r")
```

# Implementing Surveys in Shiny

## Main Functions

### UI Function

`surveyOutput()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. The documentation for it can be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::surveyOutput()` in the console.

### Server Function

`renderSurvey()` takes in a data frame of the form described above. It also takes in the input and session arguments that allow it to interface with the Shiny app. The documentation for it can be accessed by typing `?shinysurveys::renderSurvey()` in the console.

## Basic Survey

A minimal example of a survey can be created with this template:

```{r run survey, eval = FALSE}
library(shinysurveys)
ui <- shiny::fluidPage(
  shinysurveys::surveyOutput(df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions)
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  shinysurveys::renderSurvey(input = input, 
                            df = shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions,
                            session = session)
}

shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Please note that the UI comes with a "Submit" button included. Survey designers can customize actions by using the call `input$submit`. Some examples would be saving or displaying user responses. An example of that can be found [here](https://jdtrat-apps.shinyapps.io/shinysurveys_survey_submit).

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Questions

We use the term question dependencies in reference to the situations where a question should only be shown (i.e. asked) if a specific response is given to a preceding question. The questions included with the `shinysurveys` package contain many dependencies. One example we've seen discussing [multiple choice](#multiple_choice) and [text-based](#text_input) questions is the dependent for "Which best describes your gender?"

```{r what is your gender - question dependencies, echo = FALSE}
shinysurveys::teaching_r_questions %>%
  dplyr::filter(input_id == "gender" | input_id == "self_describe_gender")
```

Focusing on the columns `dependence` and `dependence_value`, we see that the text-based question will only show if the multiple choice one, with the input id of "gender" takes on the value "Prefer to self describe." That is, a question with non *NA* values in the `dependence` and `dependence_value` columns mean that it will only show if the question with the input id from `dependence` takes on the value from `dependence_value`. This can be seen below:

![](images/dependency_example_1.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![](images/dependency_example_2.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

### Required Questions {#required_questions}

Survey designers can define questions that must be answered by adding the value TRUE to the `required` column. If a required question is not answered, the user will not be able to submit their responses.

![Required question is not answered. User cannot submit their response.](images/required_submit_disabled.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

![Required question is answered. User can submit their response.](images/required_submit_enabled.png){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="300"}

### User Tracking

Built into the survey is the ability to track users based on URL parameters. If you deploy your survey on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io), or run it locally for experiments, you can add a URL parameter after the backslash as follows: `?user_id=12345`. A live demo can be found here: <https://jdtrat-apps.shinyapps.io/shinysurveys_survey_user_tracking/?user_id=hadley>
